This is an UMAT implementation of anisotropic visco-plastic constitutive model of a nickel-base directionally solidified superalloy coupled with Rabotnov–Kachanov creep damage.

For detailed theory about this constitutive model,you can check this paper:Constitutive modeling of a directionally solidified nickel-based superalloy DZ125 subjected to thermal mechanical creep fatigue loadings
